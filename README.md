College portal service


good to implement further:
- interfaces for services and DAOs
- authentication using auth0 or ocka
- I could accept the file as multipart file type and blob type in the database but, currently I am using url as content
 upload to avoid using db to store videos and webinars
- implement content storage such as s3 or minio to upload videos and webinars
